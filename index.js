// jais code
let num1 = 2;
let num2 = 31;
//62 divided by 2 is 31 yay
let num3 = 16;
let num4 = 6;
//I need an equation that will multiply to 62
let multiply = num1 * num2;
let mod = num3 % num4;
//integer division which should be greater than 0

//calculates a remainder equal to 4 (looks totally differnt in python)
let max = Math.max(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20);
//returns 20 as the highest number in the set

let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
